#### Submission for JPMC - Code for Good Hackathon 2022
In India, you are the superhero of the country, and the guardian of our destiny.
Laws meant for you and I can be shaped by people like you and I.
The process where you share feedback with the government on how a policy may impact you and your community, is known as a public consultation.

## Problem Statement
Civis is keen to tangibilize the intrinsic motivation that citizens have through gamification that acknowledges, motivates and rewards the participation by citizens.

## Our Solution
We intend to provide a in-house points system wherein users engagement can be increased by various activities on the platform and the points can then be utilized to gain rewards.
1. To provide a user friendly interface to provide engaging experience to the user.
2. To encourage users to share feedback with the government and help them with the policies.
3. To provide a common discussion platform to the community on different policies.

- The points can be gained by multiple types of engagement on the platform :
    - By taking weekly quizzes on the different kinds of laws and gaining points based on that.
    - By referring other people to take up the feedback on the laws and earn points.
    - By posting your views on the discussion forum to earn more points.
    - By sharing your profile(badge) on social media handles.

- The points gained by the individuals will be displayed in the leaderboard section in the top-down fashion.

- These points can be used to avail a number of rewards :
    - Users will be provided badges according to their points which they can show off on the social media.
    - Top-engaging users can be made a featured attendee in the talks hosted by Civis.
